# ~/public

This is my public homepage. It's open. You're welcome.

## How to get it going

1. Clone repo
1. Install dependencies `npm i` (assuming you already have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.13.0/) ~ 16.13.0 (currently LTS))
1. Run the dev server by doing `npm run dev`
1. Go to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## What I've used

Going by recommendations from friends isn't always easy, if you have more than one friend. I have two, and after consulting them, I had multiple conflicting suggestions for tools, frameworks, libraries and methods. üòÖ This diversity is a good thing, but can be frustrating for a wannabe front-end developer like yours truly. But in the end, I've settled (for now) on a few options:

- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (sort of)
- React Icons
- Publishing to Netlify

Thanks friends! üòç

## Todo

There are a lot of plans in my head. Some have materialised in sketches, and I've even started plotting out some UI in Figma. See Issues for the things I'm currently working on. And suggestions are welcome!

Some ideas:

- Homegrown blog (no db, just pre-rendered templates and markdown)
- Homegrown photo gallery (as above)
- Data from various sources, such as Twitter, weather, news and whatnot. Mostly for me.
- Eastereggs and configurability built in to the UI.
- A site-global and anonymous "likes" system

## How to contribute

Contributions to my homepage is very much welcome! If you see something you'd like to improve upon, please search through the existing issues (be prepared for profanity in both norwegian and english), and if your issue hasn'e been beaten to death already, raise a new issue and explain (preferably without profanity) what and how you want to help improve. Happy to discuss design choices and whatnot. If your issue is a bug or error, please include error messages and steps to reproduce. Let's work together on solving issues! ü§©
